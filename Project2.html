        This KeyLogger was created for **EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY**. Using this for anything malicious intent will have **legal repercussions**. 

        This KeyLogger was created in C and is intended to simulate the dangers of a KeyLogger so 
        I have a better understanding of what to look for when I encounter them in the CyberSecurity Field.
        The basic idea is that once compiled and ran it hides in the background and keeps track of each key 
        pressed and returns each individual key press to a txt file that I named System33.

        This keyLogger has the ability to log most keys and uses Microsofts Virtual-Key Values in order to do so. 
        
        I wanted to also not make something that was unrealistic i.e a file named keylogger that logs keys. 
        For real use most likley the name would be something much less obvious,
