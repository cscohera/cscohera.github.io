<h1>My CyberSecurity Passion </h1>
<p>
  Throughout my current college career I've grew a great passion for the CyberSecurity field. This really came from
  the Hack@UCF club. This CyberSecurity club has introduced me and helped devloped my CyberSecurity skills, knowledge, and Experience
  through competitions, meetings, and workshops. From there I have pursed more by creating projects and getting certifications. I have learned a
  ton from websites like Hackthebox and Tryhackme.  

</p>

<h1>What I'm Currently Pursuing</h1>
<p>
 Currently I'm looking to get my Splunk Core Certified Power User and CompTIA CySa before I graduate in the Spring. 
 I am also preparing for the Horse Plinko cyber competition in october with the goal to win this year.
 Finally, I am working with the Hack@UCF infrastructure team to keep the club running and give back to the club.
